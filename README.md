# Saving knowledge from walled gardens and ephemeral sources

A lot of knowledge is shared today in Slack channels or other walled gardens. Even if it is persisted and searchable, 
it is not organized and is hard to find - a lot harder than the public internet forums that were popular before Slack et al.

This is a collection of knowledge sourced from these places and curated for posterity.
